Eating a burrito at chipotle,"Verse 1:
I'm at Chipotle, feeling kinda hungry
Gonna grab a burrito, make it extra chunky
Beans, rice, and meat, all piled up high
Gotta get that guac, don't wanna be shy

Chorus:
Eating a burrito at Chipotle
Got my mouth watering, it's out of control
Salsa, sour cream, and cheese, oh my!
Gonna devour this thing, no need to be shy

Verse 2:
I'm in the zone, feeling like a champ
This burrito's so big, gonna need a lamp
To see through the layers, all stacked up tight
But I'm up for the challenge, gonna take a big bite

Chorus:
Eating a burrito at Chipotle
Got my mouth watering, it's out of control
Salsa, sour cream, and cheese, oh my!
Gonna devour this thing, no need to be shy

Verse 3:
I'm halfway through, feeling like a boss
This burrito's so good, it should be a cause
For celebration, with every single bite
I'm gonna savor this meal, all through the night

Chorus:
Eating a burrito at Chipotle
Got my mouth watering, it's out of control
Salsa, sour cream, and cheese, oh my!
Gonna devour this thing, no need to be shy

Outro:
I'm done with my burrito, feeling so full
But I'll be back for more, that's no bull
Chipotle, you've got me hooked
On your delicious food, I'm officially booked."
