Eating a burrito at chipotle,"Yo, I'm at Chipotle, chompin' on a burrito
Got my guac and salsa, yeah, I'm feelin' like a hero
Wrapped up tight, beans and rice inside
I take a bite, and my taste buds come alive

I love the flavor, the spice, the heat
I'm a rap king, but this burrito can't be beat
I'm savorin' every moment, chewin' slow
This is my fuel, my energy, my go-to

I'm a boss, but I still gotta eat
Chipotle's where it's at, can't be beat
So if you see me, with a burrito in my hand
Just know, I'm livin' life, the way I planned."
