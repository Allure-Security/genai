    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to answering prompts LLMs may not always return a factual response. This is especially true if the prompt asks the LLM information about something it may not necessarily know. For instance, ChatGPT was trained on data until [September 2021](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes). So if we ask it about events after this time period it might respond with a statement that it doesn't have knowledge of the event, or, it might flat out hallucinate something.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to handle this issue is to provide model with relevant context as seen in the examples below. Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG can be broken down into three steps - retrieval, augmentation, and generation. We first *retrieve* relevant data based on the prompt. This data can be stored locally, in memory, in a database etc. We can employ different search algorithms such as a keyword search, a semantic search or a hybrid search to find the relevant data. Then we *augment* our prompt by appending this data as context. Finally, we send the completed prompt to the LLM to *generate* an answer.\n",

For many years, it was used by some to mock Quebec society.[1] Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois culture and the province of Quebec. It has long been associated with Quebec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to its growing popularity throughout the rest of Canada.\\n\\nAnnual poutine celebrations occur in Montreal, Quebec City, and Drummondville, as well as Toronto, Ottawa, New Hampshire, and Chicago. It has been called \"Canada\\'s national dish\", though some critics believe this labelling represents cultural appropriation of the Québécois or Quebec\\'s national identity. Many variations on the original recipe are popular, leading some to suggest that poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, as with sandwiches and dumplings.[1]'"

      "The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]\n",
      "\n",
      "This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\n",
      "    \n",
      "Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbappé became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, for some commentators fulfilling a previously unmet criterion to be regarded the greatest player of all time.[4] Teammates Emiliano Martínez and Enzo Fernández won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal.\n",
      "    \n",
      "The choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women and members of the LGBT community, as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[D]\n",
