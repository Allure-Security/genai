    "\n",
    "Something to keep in mind while working on these problems is evaluation. Broadly, we can think of problems as falling into one of two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Generation implies an unconstrained answer space where the model can output pretty much anything. Tasks that fall into this category are things like summarization, code generation and chatbots. In these scenarios, we may have difficulty determining if an answer is correct. There are solutions to this kind of problem though and we will go into the details in future sessions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: \n",
    "\n",
    "With NLU, the set of possible answers is constrained. Tasks that fall into this category include things like classification and entity extraction. In these scenarios, there's a finite set of answers that we care about. For example, in sentiment analysis we're looking for one of positive, negative and neutral. We can easily evaluate models under this class as there are many quantitative metrics we can use here such as Precision and Recall. \n",
    "\n",
    "With open source models, it is pretty easy to get the probabilities of only the answers we want by calculating the conditional probability of each of the possible answers. That is, for a given answer X, we calculate the probability `P(X|input)` for all possible answers. The highest probability then corresponds to the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach is not possible for closed source models where we only receive direct predictions. While we unfortunately don't have access to the actual confidence of a prediction, we can still get the prediction itself and evaluate the model. This does however require us to ensure that the model gives us outputs in a consistent format that we can work with, such as a JSON or just a single word output like we've seen in the above examples."
