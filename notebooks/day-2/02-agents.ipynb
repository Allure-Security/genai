    "# Agents\n",
    "There are many types of agent that work in slightly different ways, but the main concepts behind an agent are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent has access to tools. Tools include instructions on how to use them and what they are useful for. A tool can be anything that could be used by using text.\n",
    "2. The agent has a task, usually this is just the prompt from the user.\n",
    "3. The agent has access to an LLM and a system prompt that tells it how to go about achieving it's task given it's tools\n",
    "4. The agent will attempt to breakdown its task according to its programming and iteratively take steps to achieve it. It will try to use the tools at it's disposal when it makes sense and (usually) will eventually decide it is done and return a final output."
