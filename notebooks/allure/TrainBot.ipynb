From those humble beginnings, Pacific Coast Building Products (PCBP) was born. Through the following years Fred, and later, Dave Lucchetti, the company’s president since 1978, purchased and founded building products-related businesses. By the time of Fred’s death in 1997, the company had expanded into other cities and states. Today, From its headquarters in Rancho Cordova, CA, PCBP is a holding company for seven building products distribution, manufacturing and contracting companies. The story of Pacific Coast Building Products, inc. and its family of companies is a testament to the importance of honesty, fairness and a concern for the well-being of others in everyday relationships. Fred Anderson founded his company on three core values: quality products, exceptional service and relationships. We are as committed to those values today as we were in 1953. Much has changed in the years since Fred Anderson began his first lumberyard on a shoestring, but much remains the same. Fred made it a point to get to know his customers. He listened to what they wanted and delivered a little more. He dealt fairly and honestly with people and provided the best quality building products at a fair price. While the company has grown, the culture remains the same. Treat customers, employees and suppliers like family. Develop relationships based on mutual trust and respect. Hire and train the best people for the job. None of this growth and expansion would have been possible without the scores of talented employees, along with our valued customers and partners who have been with PCBP since the beginning. PCBP is deeply grateful for their confidence and commitment to our organization, over the past 70+ years and into the future.

      "Question: We are collaborating to extract unique words, phrases, numbers, and other text strings from web pages. Our primary objective is to identify distinctive elements from a company's webpage that can assist us in pinpointing other web pages posing as the original company. Unique identifiers such as phone numbers, routing numbers, NMLS IDs, and Swift codes are of paramount importance. Moreover, distinct text strings like copyright notices and catchy taglines can be significant indicators. While shortlisting these unique elements, it's essential to ensure that their presence on a potentially deceptive page doesn't lead to an overwhelming number of false positives.\n",

      "Question: In the context of digital fraud detection, we are conducting a systematic review of web pages to extract unique textual and numerical identifiers. Primary indicators, as outlined in recent literature, include phone numbers, routing numbers, NMLS IDs, and Swift codes. Additionally, proprietary text strings such as copyright notices and distinct company slogans have been found to be pivotal in discerning authentic pages from fraudulent mimics. It is imperative, based on best practices, to calibrate the detection threshold to avoid a high rate of Type I errors, commonly referred to as false positives in the domain of fraud detection.\n",

From those humble beginnings, Pacific Coast Building Products (PCBP) was born. Through the following years Fred, and later, Dave Lucchetti, the company’s president since 1978, purchased and founded building products-related businesses. By the time of Fred’s death in 1997, the company had expanded into other cities and states. Today, From its headquarters in Rancho Cordova, CA, PCBP is a holding company for seven building products distribution, manufacturing and contracting companies. The story of Pacific Coast Building Products, inc. and its family of companies is a testament to the importance of honesty, fairness and a concern for the well-being of others in everyday relationships. Fred Anderson founded his company on three core values: quality products, exceptional service and relationships. We are as committed to those values today as we were in 1953. Much has changed in the years since Fred Anderson began his first lumberyard on a shoestring, but much remains the same. Fred made it a point to get to know his customers. He listened to what they wanted and delivered a little more. He dealt fairly and honestly with people and provided the best quality building products at a fair price. While the company has grown, the culture remains the same. Treat customers, employees and suppliers like family. Develop relationships based on mutual trust and respect. Hire and train the best people for the job. None of this growth and expansion would have been possible without the scores of talented employees, along with our valued customers and partners who have been with PCBP since the beginning.
